# INTRODUCTION

I will let others light their candles from my light about finding the longest word in a String.

# BODY

This is a classic Basic algorithm structure. Our input here is a string and our output is a number. Ultimately, we want to return the length of the longest word in the input string.

# SOLUTION

Split the string of words into an array of words.
Sort the array by length of word in descending order.
Return the length of the first element in the array.

# CONCLUSION

This what I learnt today I also understand that you will need to understand the question first , and apply your knowledge.
