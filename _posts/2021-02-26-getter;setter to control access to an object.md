# Introduction
Today I managed to learn and understand how to use the ' getter annd setter functions '.
 

# Body 
Let me share a bit of what I understand about these two Functions .....
The getter function is simply used to return (get) the values of an object's private variable to user without the user directly accessing the private variable.

Setter : meant to modify (set) the value of an objects private variable based on the setter value passed into the setter function . The change could involve calculatiions or overwriting the previous value completely.


# Conclusion 
In order to pass the test you need to add ' setter and getter ' before the instructed value . I have moved on to the third challenge but still taking things slowly so that everythig I do sinks in perfectly.
