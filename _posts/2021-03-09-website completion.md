# INTRODUCTION

We were given a task to craete our own personal websites and I have finally completed it.

# BODY

The past week has been very challenging for me because i had to setup a website from scratch. With the help of the guys here at TCG who guided me and the patience they had I was able to restart my website and re-do it again.

# CONCLUSION

Always capture notes in order to have something to guide you when you are given tasks.
