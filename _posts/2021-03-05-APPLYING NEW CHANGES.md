# INTRODUCTION
We were told to create a personal website and today we were getting te feed back . 


# BODY
The feedback I got was not quite good so i had to go back and re-do everything . I was panicking a lot and I made so many mistakes. I have had a tough experience with creating a website therefore I need to push harder.


# CONCLUSION
I have managed to apply new changes and on Monday i need to do a few touch ups.
