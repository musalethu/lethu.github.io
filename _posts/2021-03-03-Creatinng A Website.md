#INTRODUCTION
Moral had given us a task to create a Website for ourselves and i struggled so much with it.


#BODY
The process of creating a website first of all needs the previous knowledge you have from the CSS and the HTML . I had forgotten some of the knowledge and that is why I encountered some minor problems. 


#CONCLUSION
I have created the website the only thing I still need to do is assigning a picture because I had done it I just do not know how I lost all that.
