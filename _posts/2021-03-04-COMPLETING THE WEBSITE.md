# INTRODUCTION
Today it was the last day to finish up the Website i failed a lot of times but with the persistence I had I was determined that i am going to finish up the website today because tomorrow Moral is checking.


# BODY
You need to gather all the information you have from the CSS and the Html.One other thing you need to do is be able to use the Index.html and the CSS hand in hand because you need to do your styling and add a few foundation knowledge from the first FreeCodeCamp in both your folders. 


# CONCLUSION
I have managed to apply all the neccessary stuff the b log needs so i will just wait to hear from Moral tomorrow.
