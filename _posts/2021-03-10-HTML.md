# INTRODUCTION

Understanding HTML .

# BODY

HTML is for creating web pages. This is some useful information that I should have considered even  before attempting to create a website because it makes life simple. It describes the structure of a website and tells browser how to display the content which is something I did not know or rather did not pay much attention to.

# CONCLUSION

Understand the basics of web development before putting in any work because you will face many challenges. My website looks much better than the one I created before because I did my work well this time.
