# INTRODUCTION

Due to the website we were requested to create I had to dwell on the HTML basics so that i'll be able to see my mistakes.

# BODY

Revisting the HTML really helped because I was able to understand really what I needed in order to fix my website. Understanding basics was all I had to do from the beginning so that I avoid making many mistakes like I did the past week.

# CONCLUSION

Everyday when I am at TCG i will spare 2 hours for my website and apply the neccessary changes.
